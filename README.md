# git-cheatsheet

Git is a Version Control System(VCS). One of the primary function of git is keeping track of every changes of our project. To release a new version of our project we do not need to copy and paste the previous version to a new folder/directory every time. We can easily go to any version of our project by using some basic git commands. We do not need to get our hands dirty to make any changes to our project rather we simply run the commands and git will do the rest.

Besides, there are branch system on git by which we can easily add a new feature to our project and then test it to see if we need the new feature or not. We can easily add or delete the feature using git commands and we don't need to go to every files and manually remove codes for the new feature.

Enough talking!!! Now let's get familiar with some useful git commands-

Configuring git-

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "yourEmail@email.com"
```
